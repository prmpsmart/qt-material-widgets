# qt-material-widgets

> python version of cpp scripts on qt at the git repo <https://github.com/laserpants/qt-material-widgets>
> work officially started today 21-10-2021
[Details of the cpp version](cpp/qt-material-widgets-master/README.md)

> Components/lib of the cpp version converted to py, though each module is not connected yet. 

>* Each module of the **lib** has been transcoded to python, they will all be working together after the examples have also been implemented in python.

>* The Qt binding for Python used is PySide6 [Qt for Python]() 

>* The project is currently in the transcoding stage, obviously some of the code used have been deprecated since 2018 that the original code was written using cpp.

>* After all the components and examples are also transpiled, the functionality aspect will commence in less than two days later.
