# qt-material-widgets python version

> python version of cpp scripts on qt at the git repo <https://github.com/laserpants/qt-material-widgets>
>
> [Details of the cpp version](cpp/qt-material-widgets-master/README.md)
> Work officially started today 21-10-2021
>
> Components/lib of the cpp version converted to py, though each module is not connected yet.
>
>* Each module of the [**components**](py/components) has been completely transcoded to python, they will all be working together after the examples have also been implemented in python.
>
>* The Qt binding for Python used is PySide6 [Qt for Python](https://www.qt.org/qt-for-python).
>
>* The transcoding stage of the project has just been concluded, obviously some of the code used have been deprecated since 2018 that the original code was written using cpp.
>
>* After all the components and examples have been transpiled, the functionality aspect will commence later in the day as the [test_qt_material.py](py/test_qt_material.py) can be run now with all the modules imported.

## Thank you
